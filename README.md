# Scope Functions in Kotlin - Android Project

This Android project demonstrates the use of Kotlin's scope functions (`let`, `also`, `apply`, `run`, `with`) in an Android application.

## Project Structure

The main activity of the application is `MainActivity.kt`, which is located in the `com.aviva.scopefunctions` package.

In `MainActivity.kt`, each of the Kotlin scope functions is demonstrated:

- `letScopeExample()`: Demonstrates the use of `let` with a nullable variable.
- `alsoScopeExample()`: Demonstrates the use of `also` to perform a side effect operation.
- `applyScopeExample()`: Demonstrates the use of `apply` to set multiple properties of an `Intent` object.
- `runScopeExample()`: Demonstrates the use of `run` to execute a block of code on an `Intent` object.
- `withScopeExample()`: Demonstrates the use of `with` to execute a block of code on an `Intent` object.

## Running the Project

To run the project, open it in Android Studio and run the `MainActivity.kt` file.
